# Photo Gallery App

This is a photo gallery app I wrote for my Mobile Web Content and Development class (CS 641) at Pace University. It can run on mobile devices as well as web browsers. Users can upload photos to their accounts, combine photos into albums, and then share their public albums with other users by providing them with an access key.
Mobile users can also store photos and albums on their devices without having to sign in. Users can even take new photos using the cameras on their devices.

The app was built using TypeScript and React Native (via the Expo framework). The online/backend portion of this app was built using Supabase. The [supabase_notes](supabase_notes) directory contains some information about how I configured the database, storage, and Row Level Security policies.
